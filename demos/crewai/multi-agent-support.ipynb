    "## Tools, Guardrails and Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools: Here is a brief overview of tools within the CrewAI framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools** in CrewAI are external resources and APIs that AI agents can utilise to interact with data and services to complete tasks. They enhance the agents' abilities by providing access to information and functionalities beyond their internal knowledge. Tools can vary in complexity, from simple web search capabilities to complex functionalities such as interacting with databases, CRMs, or other APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key aspects of tools within CrewAI:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose**: Tools allow agents to perform actions and access external data, enabling them to accomplish complex tasks. They are essential for agents to complete tasks effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Types of Tools**: CrewAI offers a variety of built-in tools, and also allows for the creation of custom tools. Examples of tools include:\n",
    "    *   **Web Search Tools:** Like the `server dev tool`, `Google Serper Search`, `EXA Search Web Loader`, which allow agents to search the internet for information.\n",
    "    *   **Website Interaction Tools**: Like the `Scrape Website` tool, `Firecrawl Scrape Website`, and `Selenium Scraper`, which enable agents to extract content from websites. There are also tools that allow agents to perform semantic searches on website content (`Website RAG Search`).\n",
    "    *   **File and Data Tools:** These include tools for reading and writing files such as `File Read`, `File Write`, and tools for interacting with different data formats, such as `CSV RAG Search`, `JSON RAG Search`, `TXT RAG Search` and `XML RAG Search`.\n",
    "    *   **Code Execution Tools:** These include `Code Interpreter`, and `NL2SQL Tool` which enable agents to run code and execute database queries.\n",
    "    *   **Other Tools:** There are also a variety of other tools, such as `DALL-E Tool`, `Vision Tool`, `GitHub Search`, `YouTube Channel RAG Search` and `YouTube Video RAG Search` to enable agents to interact with various different services.\n",
    "*   **Custom Tools**: Users can create their own custom tools to extend the functionality of CrewAI, allowing for integration with specific services or APIs that meet their unique needs.\n",
    "*   **Tool Assignment:** Tools can be assigned to agents at two levels:\n",
    "    *   **Agent Level:** Tools assigned at this level are available to the agent for all tasks they perform.\n",
    "    *  **Task Level**: Tools assigned at this level are only available when the agent performs a specific task, these task level tools override tools assigned at the agent level.\n",
    "*   **Focused Tool Use**: It is important to avoid overloading agents with too many tools. Providing only the essential tools needed for a specific task helps agents remain focused and improves their performance. This is especially true for smaller language models, where too many tools can cause confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding and strategically utilising tools, you can enhance the performance of your AI agents and enable them to accomplish more complex objectives within CrewAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, consider exploring the various tools available in CrewAI and how each could be applied to different scenarios and agent roles.\n",

    "## Creating Tasks\n",
    "The `Task` class in CrewAI defines individual assignments or jobs that are given to agents to accomplish within a crew. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** A `Task` represents a specific action or objective that an agent needs to complete. These tasks contribute to the overall goal of the crew and produce actionable results.\n",
    "*   **Clear Objectives**: Each task should have a well-defined goal, detailing what needs to be accomplished. This clarity helps agents focus their efforts and use their tools effectively.\n",
    "*   **Tool Usage**: Tasks can specify which tools an agent should use to perform the task. **Tools assigned at the task level override tools assigned at the agent level**, providing greater control over tool usage. If no tool is specified, the agent uses the tools assigned to it at the agent level.\n",
    "*   **Inputs**: Tasks often incorporate variables that are interpolated at runtime, allowing for customisation and dynamic behaviour. This can include information like customer details or specific requirements for the task.\n",
    "*   **Expected Output**: A task definition can include clear instructions about what type of output or outcome is expected from the agent.\n",
    "*   **Integration:** Tasks are integrated into a larger process and workflow, designed to work in collaboration to achieve the crew's overall goals.\n",
    "*   **Collaboration**: Tasks can be designed to prompt collaboration between agents. For example, one task might involve generating a response that is then reviewed by another agent's task for quality assurance.\n",
    "*   **Flexibility:** Tasks can be defined for various purposes, from research and analysis to writing and customer support. Task definitions can be customised to suit the needs of the specific use case, and different types of tasks can be created to guide agents towards a specific goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "By effectively defining tasks, you can guide the behaviour of your agents and ensure they're working towards the desired outcome. This, in turn, improves the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the multi-agent system.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a next step, consider examining the use of `memory` with the crew. Specifically, investigate how short term, long term, and entity memory impact tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **`agents=[support_agent, support_quality_assurance_agent]`**: This parameter specifies the **list of agents** that will be part of this crew. In this case, there are two agents:\n",
    "    *   `support_agent`: This agent is designed to act as a **senior support representative**, focused on being friendly and helpful. Its role is to assist customers with their inquiries.\n",
    "    *   `support_quality_assurance_agent`: This agent acts as a **quality assurance (QA) specialist**, responsible for fact-checking the responses of the support agent. It ensures that the information given to customers is accurate and comprehensive. The QA agent has the ability to delegate tasks back to the support agent if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`tasks=[inquiry_resolution, quality_assurance_review]`**: This parameter defines the **list of tasks** that will be performed within the crew. There are two tasks:\n",
    "    *   `inquiry_resolution`: This task is assigned to the `support_agent`. It involves addressing customer inquiries, using provided tools and information to deliver comprehensive answers.\n",
    "    *   `quality_assurance_review`: This task is assigned to the `support_quality_assurance_agent`. It involves reviewing the work done by the `support_agent` to ensure its quality and accuracy. This task does not include any tools of its own and only assesses what the support agent has written.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`verbose=2`**: This parameter sets the verbosity level of the crew's execution. A value of `2` likely means that the crew will output detailed information about the execution, such as what each agent is doing, which tasks are being performed, and any outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`memory=True`**: This parameter enables memory for the crew, allowing the agents to store and access information during and across task executions. With memory enabled, agents benefit from three types of memory:\n",
    "    *   **Short-term memory:** This memory is active during the crew execution and is shared across all agents, enabling them to exchange context and learnings as they work.\n",
    "    *  **Long-term memory:** This memory persists even after the crew finishes. It stores information in a database, allowing agents to learn from past executions and improve over time.\n",
    "    *   **Entity memory:** This memory is also short lived, and stores what subjects are being discussed by agents during the execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this `Crew` object is designed to handle customer support inquiries by utilising two specialised agents, each with specific tasks. The support agent addresses the initial inquiry, while the QA agent reviews the response for quality. The `memory` parameter ensures that agents can learn and adapt based on previous interactions. The verbosity level is set to provide detailed output of the execution process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A next step would be to investigate how each of the agents and tasks are defined in more detail including any tools that have been assigned and any prompts or instructions provided. This will provide a deeper understanding of how the crew operates.\n"
